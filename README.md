This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs involving the premature termination of loops using EXIT PERFORM. The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides a corrected version. The error occurs when EXIT PERFORM is used within a conditional statement, causing the loop to terminate before its intended completion condition is met. This can lead to incomplete processing or inaccurate results.
